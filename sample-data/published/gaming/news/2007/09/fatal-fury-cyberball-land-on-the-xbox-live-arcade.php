With <a href="/reviews/games/Beautiful-corruption-a-review-of-Metroid-Prime-3.ars"><em>Metroid Prime 3</em></a> under my belt, and now catch-up sessions of <a href="/reviews/games/a-different-kind-of-rapture-a-review-of-bioshock.ars"><em>Bioshock</em></a>, late nights of <a href="/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/08/30/call-of-duty-4-public-beta-underway"><em>Call of Duty 4</em></a>, and the imminent&nbsp;conquest of <a href="/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/07/13/ars-at-e3-hands-on-with-stranglehold"><em>Stranglehold</em></a>, I&#39;ve got quite a bit of gaming to do these days. However, that certainly didn&#39;t stop me from trying out this week&#39;s Xbox Live Arcade releases. Two new games hit the Xbox Live Marketplace yesterday: <em>Cyberball 2072</em> and <em>Fatal Fury Special</em>, both classics from different eras and both available for 400 Microsoft Points ($5) each.

For the most part, <em>Fatal Fury</em> is of the same caliber as the previously released <em>Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting</em>, which means that game has the requisite leaderboards, online multiplayer, and frustrating d-pad problems. The biggest gripe I have with the game is that, unlike last week&#39;s <em>Streets of Rage</em>, you can&#39;t turn off the sprite smoothing effect meant to make the game look cleaner. In actuality, this renders the once-pristine sprites a muddy mess. It&#39;s still playable if you can best the controller, but I&#39;d personally recommend picking up a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/k/kingoffighters0203/details.page/"><em>King of Fighters</em> Xbox collection</a>.

<a href="http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/09/05/arcade-cyberball-2072.aspx#comments"><em>Cyberball</em> <em>2072</em></a>, on the other hand, is pretty solid for what it is. Apparently an arcade classic that was in turn ported to a bunch of different systems, the game essentially boils down to robotic American football where the ball is a bomb and you have to score or cross the 50 yard line before it blows up. An RPG-esque system of upgrading your team&#39;s robots exists, and for the most part the game plays well. Alas, the 360&#39;s d-pad becomes a problem again, but it&#39;s less noticeable than in the fighting games.

If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Cyberball 2072</em>, you may want to check out the Xbox Live Arcade version, but for the rest of us I think it&#39;s safe to avoid any purchases this week. Here&#39;s hoping next week&#39;s releases are a little more exciting.
