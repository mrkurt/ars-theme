Ah, Wii remote lightsaber dueling. Since the day that the Revolution was first announced, the dream of wielding the remote like a lightsaber has been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/06/28/lucasarts-taunts-with-hints-at-upcoming-wii-lightsaber-game">a common thread</a> connecting gamers across the world. And now, apparently, that dream will finally come true. LucasArts and Travellers Tales have announced that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/05/24/lego-star-wars-to-come-back-with-all-six-movies-in-one-game"><em>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</em></a> will ship with motion control lightsaber combat and will be demoed publicly for the first time at the upcoming Gamecity event in Nottingham. 
</p>
<p>
This announcement comes in conjunction with Gamecity&#39;s &quot;Play the Force&quot; event, which is a &quot;celebration of the rich heritage that games share with the Star Wars phenomenon.&quot; Attendees will &quot;be the first in the world get their hands on the Wii&reg; lightsaber,&quot; and will be &quot;allowing players to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2006/05/04/3838">battle with thrusts and slices</a> of the Remote.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Those near Nottingham or willing to make the trip out can buy tickets <a href="http://www.gamecity.org/">on the event&#39;s website</a>. <em>Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga</em> is slated to hit the Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS on November 6.
