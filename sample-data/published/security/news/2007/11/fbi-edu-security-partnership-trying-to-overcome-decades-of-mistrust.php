Two weeks ago, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071022-national-academies-tackles-international-science-in-the-age-of-terrorism.html">we described</a> a report from the Natioasdfnal Research Council on the challenges of balancing an open academic research environment with the risks that the fruits of the research could be adopted by terrorists.  One of the repasdfort&#39;s recommendations was the formation of a standing committee comprised of academics and members of the national security agencies.  It turns out that the FBI had already heeded similar advice&mdash;back in 2005.
</p>
<p>
The FBI&#39;sasdf National Security Higher Education Advisory Board was formed in 2005 and has been meeting several times a year since.  Its chair, Graham Spanier, is president of Pennsylvania State University, and the 20-member panel has included among its members heads of many prestigious research institutions, including Cornell, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Carnegie Mellon, NYU, and many major state universities.  
</p>
<p>
At the time of its formation, the NSHEAB was presented as a two-way street, with the discussions intended to keep each side informed of the other&#39;s needs.  &quot;It is critical that those entrusted with our national security better understand the valuable contributions our universities make to research discoveries, education of young adults, international collaboration, faculty and student exchanges, and the development of intellectual property,&quot; Spanier said at the time.  He&#39;s <a href="http://president.psu.edu/editorials/articles/security.html">since praised</a> the &quot;remarkable and productive dialog&quot; that&#39;s occurred through the NSHEAB
</p>
<p>
The FBI has posted <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/page2/april06/academicalliance040506.htm">a general description</a> of how it views the goals of NSHEAB, as well as a related program focused on smaller schools.  Still, very little information is available from the agency regarding the activities of NSHEAB; most of it focuses on personnel matters.  At the time the program was announced, the FBI stated that it &quot;is grateful that these distinguished educators and national leaders are willing to advise on how we can work together with higher education in order to fulfill our increasingly challenging missions.&quot;  FBI Director Robert Mueller, however, appeared to have some very specific ideas on how university leaders could help out, suggesting, &quot;We also want to foster exchanges between academia and the FBI in order to develop curricula which will aid in attracting the best and brightest students to careers in the law enforcement and intelligence communities.&quot;
</p>
<p>
Sending those sorts of ambiguous signals may be enough to help the FBI overcome decades of mistrust.  NPR <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16067492">explored the reception</a> that the FBI and NSHEAB are getting from some in the academic community, and the report describes a general skepticism that it ascribes to the agency&#39;s activities in the 1960s, when its domestic espionage was directed towards many in the academic community.  Still, those concerns haven&#39;t apparently limited the NSHEAB&#39;s meetings or membership.
</p>
<p>
The issues that are meant to be the focus of NSHEAB&#39;s work&mdash;industrial espionage and terrorism&mdash;are precisely those that were described in the National Research Council&#39;s report.  NSHEAB appears to be exactly the sort of joint academic-security collaboration the NRC called for; as such, it would be a disappointment if academic mistrust or unreasonable expectations from the FBI limited its effectiveness.
